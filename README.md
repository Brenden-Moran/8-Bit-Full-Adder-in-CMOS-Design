This is a simple 8-bit value adder where it takes two inputs (A and B) and stores the result in another 8-bit value (Result).

Each adder is implememnted using CMOS transistor design using the software Digital to design it. 
You can find the design in the file labeled 8_Bit_adder_CMOS.dig

Please reference the PDF file labeled (8_bit_adder_CMOS_info.PDF) for more information on how the adder actually works and the steps taken to create the adder.
